### API Key Structure and Interpretation

The API key structure for NumeralHQ's services follows a specific pattern that ensures both security and clarity. The structure is defined as `{exposure}_{environment}_{identifier}`, and each component has a distinct purpose. Understanding these components is crucial for properly managing and utilizing the API keys.

#### Components of the API Key

1. **Exposure**: This part of the key indicates the level of exposure or accessibility of the key.

   - `sk`: This stands for `secret_key`. A secret key must be kept secure and should only be used on the server-side. It should never be exposed in client-side code or any public-facing part of your application. Secret keys are necessary for operations that require secure access to NumeralHQ’s APIs.

2. **Environment**: This part of the key specifies the operational environment where the key will be used.

   - `prod`: Indicates that the key is for the production environment. Keys used in this environment handle live traffic, and all transactions recorded will incur charges and tax remittance.
   - `test`: Indicates that the key is for the test or staging environment. This environment is used for development and testing purposes. Transactions recorded with test keys will not incur any charges or tax remittance.

3. **Identifier**: This is a unique string of characters that differentiates each key. The identifier ensures that each key is unique, even if the exposure and environment parts are the same.

#### Example and Usage

Consider the API key example: `sk_prod_23dvve554h65yegwf23wr4r5er`. Here’s how to interpret it:

- `sk`: This is a secret key, meaning it should never be exposed in client-side code or any public-facing part of your application.
- `prod`: This key is intended for the production environment, implying it will handle live traffic and associated transactions will be billed and taxed.
- `23dvve554h65yegwf23wr4r5er`: This unique identifier ensures the key is distinct and can be tracked and managed separately from other keys.

By adhering to this structured format, NumeralHQ ensures that API keys are easily identifiable and managed according to their intended use, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.
