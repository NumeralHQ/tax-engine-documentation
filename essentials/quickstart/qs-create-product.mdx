### Four steps to your first transaction

1. Get a TEST API key from your Numeral Dashboard
2. **Create a product with a POST to `/tax/products`**
3. Query a tax calculation with a POST to `/tax/calculations`
4. Record a transaction with a POST to `/tax/transactions`

## 2. Create your first product

Before you request any calculations, you'll need to create a categorized product to calculate against.
This makes sure that you and your business are compliant anytime you collect tax.

```cURL cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.numeralhq.com/tax/products \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "reference_product_id": "test-p-01",
  "reference_product_name": "Test Product",
  "product_category": "GENERAL_MERCHANDISE"
}' | json_pp
```

Take the API key you generated in Step 1, and put it in place of `<token>` in the above cURL expression.
Copy that into your terminal, and hit enter.
You should receive a response that looks like this:

```cURL cURL
{
  "object": "tax.product",
  "reference_product_id": "test-p-01",
  "reference_product_name": "Test Product",
  "product_category": "GENERAL_MERCHANDISE",
  "created_at": 1721694425,
  "updated_at": 1721694425,
  "testmode": "true"
}
```

You should see this new product also show up in your Numeral dashboard under the 'Products' tab.

Before you start creating products for production, learn more about what `products` are [on this page](/objects/products), and get the complete documentation for creating them on [this page](/api-reference/endpoint/products).
Also, anytime you create a product, it will need a category. In this quickstart, we categorized our test product as `GENERAL_MERCHANDISE`. Check out our full categorization taxonomy on [this page](/essentials/product-categories).

Now that you've set up a product, you'll be able to calculate taxes against it. In production, this means you'll be able to charge taxes as checkout. Using this test product, let's see how to get a tax calculation!
