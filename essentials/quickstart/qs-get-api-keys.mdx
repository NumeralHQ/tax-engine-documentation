### Four steps to your first transaction

1. **Get a TEST API Key from your Numeral Dashboard**
2. Create a product with a POST to `/tax/products`
3. Query a tax calculation with a POST to `/tax/calculations`
4. Record a transaction with a POST to `/tax/transactions`

## 1. Get your API credentials

- Log into your Numeral dashboard
- Go into the "API Keys" tab in your top ribbon
- Select the blue "Create API Key" button
- In the pop-up, ensure the toggle is set to "test," and push "Create API Key"

Congrats! You've created your first API key. You'll use it in the next few steps, so make note of it.
