### Four steps to your first transaction

1. Get a TEST API key from your Numeral Dashboard
2. Create a product with a POST to `/tax/products`
3. Query a tax calculation with a POST to `/tax/calculations`
4. Record a transaction with a POST to `/tax/transactions`

Welcome to Numeral. We provide a modern, easy to use API to help you accurately charge, collect, and file sales tax.

This quickstart guide will take you through the core functionality of our API and help you get acquainted with how you may choose to integrate the API with your unique system.

While this quickstart will get things underway, make sure to read through the rest of the documentation to ensure you get a sense of our API's full breadth of capabilities. Get started by minting your first API keys, with instructions on the next page.
