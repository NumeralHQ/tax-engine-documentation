## What is a Product?

Products are the items/SKUs that you sell. To make the tax categorization as easy as possible, we allow you to upload all of your products into to our system. This way, when you sell a product, you can simply tell us which product you
are selling and we will automatically apply the correct tax rate to the product.

## When to use Products?

Before you can start creating [calculations](/objects/calculations), you will need to create at least one `product`. When you create a product you will tell us 3 key pieces of information:

#### Reference Product ID

This `id` is used to uniquely identify this product both in your system (and in ours). This will be the `id` that you use when you reference this product on a line item within a [calculation](/objects/calculations)

#### Product Category

The product category is used to determine which tax rate to apply to this product. This is done by identifying one of the categories from our [Product Tax Categories](/objects/product-tax-categories) list.

#### Reference Product name

This value, while not critical for determining taxes, is used to display this product in all reporting and reconciliation dashboards. This can be helpful for verifying transactions.
