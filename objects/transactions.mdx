## What is a Transaction?

The `transaction` object is used to represent an actual sale or completed purchase in your system. We will determine taxes owed based on all `transaction`s that take place during a time period for any specific taxing jurisdiction.

```json
{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

## When to create Transactions

Upon a successful purchase of a product, you will want to create a `transaction` object. This transaction will tell Numeral which products were purchased, when the purchase happened, the total amount of the purchase, and the total tax owed for the purchase.
