## What is a Calculation

The `calculation` object is used to represent all of the tax calculations that _might eventually_ be used to create a real-world order or transaction. This includes taxes on a per-line item basis as well as totals for the order as a whole. Here's an example of what information exists within a calculation:

```json
{
  "calculation_id": "calc_123456789",
  "object": "tax.calculation",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "line_item_id": "line_987654321",
      "reference_product_id": "p-1233543",
      "reference_product_name": "Widget",
      "product_tax_code": "1234567890",
      "tax_included_in_amount": true,
      "tax_jurisdictions": [
        {
          "tax_rate": 0.07,
          "rate_type": "REDUCED_RATE",
          "jurisdiction_name": "State"
        }
      ],
      "tax_amount": 14,
      "amount_excluding_tax": 200,
      "amount_including_tax": 214
    }
  ],
  "total_tax_amount": 14.5,
  "total_amount_excluding_tax": 200,
  "expires_at": 1714787673,
  "testmode": "false"
}
```

## When to use Calculations

Let's say that you have a cart page within an ecommerce checkout experience. As your customer is modifying their purchase, changing their shipping addres, etc, you will want to show them the most accurate
taxes for their purchase in as close to real time as possible. To do this you will submit a `POST` to `/tax/calculations` and then update the results on the page each time the customer modifies their purchase.
